# SNHU-465
Architecture:
The frontend-side application of the project was developed using Express, a node.js framework.
handlebars were used to create templates and render the HTML pages.
The single-page application (SPA) was developed using Angular, a frontend framework that is fantastic for developing SPAS. A SPA works by first taking the HTTP request sent by the user to the site and responding with everything needed to render the webpage and its functions.
This provides the client the fully rendered page without needing to stay connected to a network consistently to view and is considerably more efficient on server usage by having the page loaded entirely on the requesters browser instead of needing to constantly put out requests to the same user loading multiple pages.
NoSQL MongoDB was used as the database to store the trips information and the registered users.
On top of that, NoSQL MongoDB provides speed, structure, and functionality.

Functionality:
JavaScript is a programming language, JavaScript was used to develop the API functionality.
JSON is a data transmission format, JSON helps in organizing the data for the application and making it so the data is not hard coded into the HTML files.
At first, we were only using the JSON data files to use within the public web application. Then, we moved them so that the API could access them easier.
When coding, it was the same process for each page on the web application. Since these pages were easy to replicate, it would be simple if the website had to be changed.
